  "summary": "REQ-34 appears implemented via JSON-LD LocalBusiness/HealthClub structured data in frontend/index.html including the GBP URL and address. REQ-33 is only partially evidenced: the Footer adds a GBP icon link, but the acceptance criteria requires a clearly labeled (text) link in the Footer (and Contact page), which is not clearly shown in the diff snippets (Footer appears icon-only; Contact button text is truncated).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-33",
      "requirement": "Footer includes a clearly labeled (English text) Google Business Profile link that opens in a new tab with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" and matches the luxury styling.",
      "reason": "In the Footer diff, the GBP link is represented by a Google icon (<SiGoogle />) with a title attribute, but no visible English label text is shown, which does not meet the 'clearly labeled link' acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "A GBP link/button is added on the Contact page, but the diff is truncated before the button text/label is visible, so the acceptance criterion of a 'clearly labeled' English link cannot be verified from the provided diff evidence.",
